## Description

Chat Application, inspired by Whatsapp and AOL Instant Messager and Facebook Messenger. Imagine those three applications had a 3-some and... well this is the app. 

YM = YaelMessage

The highlight of the messenger is you can create tabs, to have sub-conversations within a conversation with someone.
